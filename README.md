# facts-delivery

It was originally using the cat facts API,
but just after three days I started making this project
the cat facts API is no longer available anymore. (maybe just runs out of bandwidth this month?)
So I changed the API and now it's Jokes Delivery!

The API I used in this project:
[official_joke_api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api/)

### Run Locally

- Clone the repo
- `npm i && npm run start`

### Build

Run package first,

- `npm run package`

then if you want to build for Mac:

- `npm run buildm`

or build for Windows:

- `npm run buildw`

And find the files in the dist folder.
I have also put the built file on my Google Drive:

- [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFIwQcye9ZDNjkTfKk51Yr5NMVphLeQB/view?usp=sharing)
- [MAC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oJigpvjjKpVqNB7jIbLi9CC1oQ-l30Ph/view?usp=sharing)

### Unit Test

- `npm run test`

### Things To Do

Maybe use a database to store favourites
or build a login system to store favourites with user's data.
